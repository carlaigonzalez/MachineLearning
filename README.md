# MachineLearning

Course Description (from syllabus)
This course will cover relevant fundamental concepts in machine learning (ML) and how
they are used to solve real-world problems. Students will learn the theory behind a variety
of machine learning tools and practice applying the tools to real-world data such as
numerical data, textual data (natural language processing), and visual data (computer
vision). Each class is divided into two segments: (a) Theory and Methods, a concise
description of an ML concept, and (b) Lab Tutorial, a hands-on session on applying the
theory just discussed to a real-world task on publicly available data. We will use Python for
programming.
